        <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
        <div class="abstract-content">
        My talk will describe a state of the art image based modelling in several seemingly different areas of biology. I will  show examples from biomedical (lymphatic, vascular and lung system) and agricultural problems of plant-soil interaction. I will describe the workflow from imaging (X-ray CT, XRF, SEM-EDX, histology), image reconstruction, image segmentation, computation and how to utilize this work stream to synthesise new scientific knowledge. In particular I will also outline several challenges and bottle necks in this process to hopefully encourage more mathematicians to get involved in the full pipeline.

        <div class="abstract-content">
        Sleep is essential for healthy human function. Sleep may seem mysterious, but it is an area in which high level mathematical models have been pivotal in the development of our understanding – and is an area where considerable opportunities exist for further mathematical insight. In this talk I’ll introduce the nonsmooth coupled oscillator systems that form the basis of current mathematical models of sleep-wake regulation and discuss their dynamical behaviour. I will describe how we are using models to unravel environmental, societal and physiological factors that determine sleep timing and how we are combining models and data to develop digital twins for sleep-wake regulation, with the aim of creating personalised guidance to ameliorate delayed sleep timing disorders.

        <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
        <div class="abstract-content">
     In this talk, I will present a hybrid individual cell-based mathematical and computational model, incorporating single-cell based intracellular dynamics, the cell microenvironment and cell-cell interactions to study the growth and progression of cancer cell mass.   The modelling framework will then be used to study the effects of various anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, illustrating its adaptability and potential use. Furthermore, we will see how this modelling framework can be used to understand the role of known mechanisms in driving treatment effects and while in some cases, how it can provide testable hypotheses on poorly understood concepts such as “radiation-induced bystander effects”.

        <em>Title: Data-driven landscape modelling of the early neural tube</em><br>
        <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
        <div class="abstract-content">
       Building a mechanistic understanding of cell fate decisions remains a fundamental goal of developmental biology, with implications for stem cell therapies, regenerative medicine and understanding disease mechanisms. Single-cell transcriptomics should provide key information for their analysis, but building quantitative and predictive models from these data remains a challenge. I will present dynamic landscape analysis (DLA), a framework that applies dynamical systems theory to identify stable cell states, map transition pathways, and generate predictive cell fate models from single-cell data. Applying this framework to vertebrate neural tube development reveals that progenitor specification by Sonic Hedgehog can be captured in a landscape with an unexpected circular topology, where initially divergent lineages converge through multiple routes. This model accurately predicted cellular responses and cell fate allocation for unseen dynamic signalling regimes. By modelling the dynamic responses that drive cell fate decisions, the DLA framework provides a quantitative and generative framework for extracting mechanistic insights from high-dimensional single-cell data.

        <em>Title: Evolutionary dynamics of extra-chromosomal DNA</em><br>
        <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
        <div class="abstract-content">
      Extra-chromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a genetic error found in more than 30% of tumour samples across various cancer types. It is a key driver of oncogene amplification promoting tumour progression and therapeutic resistance and is correlated to the worse clinical outcomes. Different from chromosomal DNA where genetic materials are on average equally divided to daughter cells controlled by centromeres during mitosis, the segregation of ecDNA copies is random partition and leads to a fast accumulation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in copy numbers.  I will present our analytical and computational modeling of ecDNA dynamics under random segregation, examining the impact of copy-number-dependent versus -independent fitness, as well as the maintenance and de-mixing of multiple ecDNA species or variants within single cells. By integrating experimental and clinical data, our results demonstrate that ecDNA is not merely a by-product but a driving force in tumor progression. Intra-tumor heterogeneity exists not only in copy number but also in genetic and phenotypic diversity. Furthermore, ecDNA fitness can be copy-number dependent, which has significant implications for treatment.

        <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
        <div class="abstract-content">
        Aerial views of intertidal mussel beds often reveal large scale striped patterns aligned perpendicular to the direction of the tide; dense bands of mussels alternate periodically with near bare sediment.  I will describe a mathematical model for mussel beds, and show that it predicts this type of striped pattern for some parameter sets, with spotted patterns predicted in other cases.  I will show that mathematical investigation of the stability of the stripes in 2-D explains when spots occur rather than stripes, and reveals a new type of hysteresis in pattern formation.

        <em>Title: Airway remodeliing in asthma - the chicken or the egg?</em><br>
        <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
        <div class="abstract-content">
   Inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (which causes constriction of the airways at lower trigger levels than in normal subject) and airway remodelling (long term structural changes of the airway wall) are key features of asthma. While this is well-established, it is not clear how they are linked or whether they are causes or symptoms of the disease. In this talk I will describe a theoretical morphoelastic model of asthmatic airways, developed in parallel with an experimental study, that accounts for mechanochemical drivers of airway remodelling with some illustrative results. I will discuss the effect of remodelling on the mechanical properties of the airways and consequent changes in how the lung is ventilated. Finally I will describe insights into how homoeostasis could be maintained in healthy airways and therefore what perturbations might drive the airway into a diseased state.
