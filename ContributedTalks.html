      <strong>Title:</strong> Mechanistic modelling of cluster formation in metastatic melanoma<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, yet survival rates are excellent if it is diagnosed early. However, if metastasis occurs, five-year survival rates drop significantly. During the early stages of tumour initiation, melanoma cells form clusters within the primary tumour which promote metastasis. In the absence of biological tools to visualise cluster formation at primary tumour sites, we develop mathematical models to generate mechanistic insight into their formation. For this work we utilise in vitro data for two distinct melanoma cell phenotypes, one more proliferative and the other more invasive. This data consists of experiments for each phenotype individually, resulting in homogeneous clusters, as well as mixtures of the two phenotypes, resulting in heterogeneous clusters. We develop a series of differential-equation-based models using a coagulation-fragmentation-proliferation framework to describe the growth dynamics of homogeneous clusters, incorporating different functional forms for cell proliferation and cluster splitting. We then extend these models to describe the formation of heterogeneous cell clusters by considering both cluster size and phenotypic composition. We fit the models to experimental data, using a Bayesian framework to perform parameter inference and information criteria to perform model selection. In this way, we characterise and quantify differences in the clustering behaviour of two melanoma phenotypes in homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters, particularly the cluster coagulation, proliferation, and splitting rates. We find that the coagulation rate for the invasive phenotype is much larger than that for the proliferative phenotype, and evaluate how well different modelling assumptions fit the data in order to increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving metastasis. In future work, the models will be used to inform further experiments and, in particular, to suggest and test strategies for inhibiting metastasis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Predicting Treatment Outcomes from Adaptive Therapy - A New Mathematical Biomarker<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Adaptive therapy (AT) protocols have been introduced to combat drug-resistance in cancer, and are characterized by breaks in maximum tolerated dose treatment (the current standard of care in most clinical settings). These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. Promising clinical results in prostate cancer indicate the potential of adaptive treatment protocols, but demonstrate broad heterogeneity in patient response. This naturally leads to the question: why does this heterogeneity occur, and is a `one-size-fits-all' protocol best for patients across this spectrum of responses?  Using a Lotka-Volterra representation of drug-sensitive and -resistant tumor populations' dynamics, we obtain a predictive expression for the expected benefit from Adaptive Therapy and show that this can identify the best responders in a clinical dataset. Building on prior theoretical analyses, we obtain an analytic expression for the optimal treatment strategy, based on individual patient tumor dynamics. In contrast to prior approaches, this strategy also accounts for clinical limitations such as fixed time intervals between clinical appointments, to produce clinically realistic treatment strategies. We show that this strategy varies significantly between patients, and present a framework to generate individual treatment schedules from a patient's initial treatment data. Finally, we develop metrics (‘mathematical biomarkers’) to predict which patients have the greatest sensitivity to unplanned schedule changes, such as delayed appointments, allowing clinicians to identify high-risk patients that need to be monitored more closely and potentially more frequently. Overall, the proposed mathematical biomarkers illustrate the potential of analytic approaches to improve personalised cancer care.

      <strong>Title:</strong> A Multiorgan and Genuinely Hybrid 3D Cancer Metastasis Model over Virtual Patient Framework <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
       Cancer invasion is a hallmark of malignancy, driven by the ability of cancer cells to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and infiltrate surrounding tissues. This process is central to tumour progression and metastasis and involves complex interactions among cancer cells, ECM components, matrix-degrading enzymes, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a key phenotypic shift enabling cancer cells to transition from a proliferative epithelial state to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype.    In this presentation, we introduce a suite of 3D mathematical models that capture the proliferation of epithelial-like cancer cells (ECs) and the invasion strategies of mesenchymal-like cancer cells (MCs). We begin with simplified models, discussing the existence and properties of classical solutions, before advancing to a multiscale hybrid stochastic-deterministic (SDE-PDE) framework with predictive capacity in realistic experimental settings. We conclude by presenting recent extensions of our model towards a multi-organ cancer invasion framework, outlining our initial steps in developing a mathematical foundation for a virtual cancer patient.    This presentation is based on joint works with M. Chaplain, A. Madzvamuse, N. Harbour, T. Williams, L. Franssen, C. Verbeeck, Ch. Surulescu, N. Kolbe, and D. Katsaounis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Mathematical modelling of tendon damage <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Tendons are connective tissues between muscle and bone. Tendinopathy is a common and painful pathology of the tendon affecting all ages, characterised by changes in its structure and composition. We aim to build a mathematical model to elucidate how altered tendon structure affects its function. Tendons are made up of 50-70% water and a collagen-heavy solid matrix, and undergo large deformations. We present a non-linear poroelastic model, assuming Darcy flow through the pores of the solid skeleton, to capture the bulk mechanics of the tissue. The solid skeleton is assumed to be formed primarily of crimped collagen fibrils that only bear load once fully taut, embedded in an isotropic background matrix. To model this, we derive a strain energy density for the solid skeleton assuming the fibrils are individually Hookean and the background matrix is neo-Hookean. We apply a uniaxial cyclic stress or displacement at the muscle boundary, and assume the bone is rigid and impermeable. We explore the effect of tendon damage by considering modifications to the solid constitutive law, such as altering collagen stiffness, fibril crimp angle and distribution, and determine how this affects the bulk poroelastic response of the tissue.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modelling the mechanics of material replacement in biological systems <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Many biological systems contain material components that are repaired and replaced over time by accompanying cells. One common example is the extra-cellular matrix, an interconnected network of proteins that provides chemical and mechanical protection and support in many systems, such as tissue basement membranes and bacterial biofilms. Questions remain as to how the bulk mechanical properties of the material depend on cell maintenance. I will present a mathematical model of a system of springs that aims to capture how the microscale replacement of elastic material can give rise to different observed bulk mechanical behaviours. Despite the model’s simplicity, it has a number of interesting characteristics that are biologically-relevant.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modelling the impact of airway secretions on respiratory dynamics using ventilator waveforms <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      A mechanistic compartmental model is developed to investigate the impact of airway secretion accumulation and its removal on respiratory dynamics in mechanically ventilated patients. The model incorporates airway resistances, lung and chest wall compliances, and simulates patient effort through a respiratory muscle pressure generating term, capturing key patient ventilator interactions. The model, when validated with clinical ventilator waveform data, reveals distinct changes in waveform patterns, such as reduced inspiratory flow and prolonged expiration associated with secretion accumulation. To explore the clinical relevance of these findings, ventilator waveform recordings from 35 patients were analysed before and after airway clearance. The distributions of waveform features, identified by the model as sensitive to secretion accumulation, were compared using Wasserstein distance to quantify changes before and after secretion clearance. These features, when used in unsupervised clustering, revealed distinct patient clusters corresponding to low, medium, and high secretion burden. Our model-informed approach underscores the influence of secretion-induced changes on ventilation dynamics and highlights the potential of waveform-based analysis for real-time, non-invasive secretion monitoring and personalized respiratory care.

      <strong>Title:</strong> The importance of being subcritical - hysteresis and Maxwell equal-energy criteria in biological pattern formation  <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      In this talk I shall survey recent work by myself and collaborators on an alternative view to the classical Turing-pattern view of the onset of pattern in biological systems. The chief context is that of cell polarity formation in which small GTPases that come in inactive cytosolic and active membrane-bound forms. We shall argue that for typical parameter values the symmetry-breaking bifurcation is typically subcritical. The onset of spatial pattern then occurs in a perfect system at the Maxwell point where homogeneous and spatial patterned states have equal values of some notion of energy. The existence of this Maxwell point not only makes spatially localised patterns more prevalent, but also adds additional complexity to the so-called Busse balloon of stable periodic patterns with different wavenumber.  There are additional complexities if timescales are such that protein species are preserved. Then there is a propensity to form polarity through spatial fronts, whose location can be predicted by a novel theory of wave-pinning. Applications are discussed at very different spatial scales, namely plant cell polarity formation and the spatial ecology of desertification and savanna-rainforest transition. The overall conclusion is that biology is likely to favour subcritical bifurcation with its consequent hysteresis as this allows robust, sudden transitions to occur in the presence of slow and/or noisy parameter variation.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Delayed loss of stability of periodic travelling waves affects wavelength changes of patterned ecosystems. <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Many patterned ecosystems, such as dryland vegetation patterns and intertidal mussel beds can be described by PDEs admitting periodic travelling waves (PTWs). Under a changing environment that increases stress, such systems undergo a cascade of wavelength changes before an extinction event occurs. Classically, wavelength changes have been predicted by identifying the intersection of a PTW’s wavelength contour with a stability boundary in the system’s Busse balloon. In this talk, I highlight that this information is often insufficient because of a delayed loss of stability phenomenon. I show that PTWs can persist as transients for ecologically significant times after the crossing of a stability boundary in the Busse balloon. I present a method that can predict the order of magnitude of the time delay between the crossing of a stability boundary and the occurrence of a wavelength change by linking the delay to features of the essential spectra of the PTWs.

      <strong>Title:</strong> The role of mutants in the progression of inflammatory bowel disease: three classes of permanent form travelling waves <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Despite its high prevalence and impact on the lives of those affected, a complete understanding of the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. We investigate a novel mechanism which proposes that mutant epithelial cells are significant to the progression of IBD since they promote inflammation and are resistant to death. We develop a simple model encapsulating the propagation of mutant epithelial cells and immune cells which results from interactions with the intestinal barrier and bacteria. Motivated by the slow growth of mutant epithelial cells, and relatively slow response rate of the adaptive immune system, we combine geometric singular perturbation theory with matched asymptotic expansions to determine the one-dimensional slow invariant manifold that characterises the leading order dynamics at all times beyond a passive initial adjustment phase. The dynamics on this manifold are controlled by a bifurcation parameter, which depends on the ratio of growth to decay rates of all components except mutants and determines three distinct classes of permanent-form travelling waves that describe the propagation of mutant epithelial and immune cells.  These are obtained from scalar reaction-diffusion equations with the reaction being (i) a bistable nonlinearity with a cut-off, (ii) a cubic Fisher nonlinearity and (iii) a KPP or Fisher nonlinearity. Our results suggest that mutant epithelial cells are critical to the progression of IBD.  However, their effect on the speed of progression is subdominant.  </div>
