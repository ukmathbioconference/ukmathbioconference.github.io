      <strong>Title:</strong> Mechanistic modelling of cluster formation in metastatic melanoma<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, yet survival rates are excellent if it is diagnosed early. However, if metastasis occurs, five-year survival rates drop significantly. During the early stages of tumour initiation, melanoma cells form clusters within the primary tumour which promote metastasis. In the absence of biological tools to visualise cluster formation at primary tumour sites, we develop mathematical models to generate mechanistic insight into their formation. For this work we utilise in vitro data for two distinct melanoma cell phenotypes, one more proliferative and the other more invasive. This data consists of experiments for each phenotype individually, resulting in homogeneous clusters, as well as mixtures of the two phenotypes, resulting in heterogeneous clusters. We develop a series of differential-equation-based models using a coagulation-fragmentation-proliferation framework to describe the growth dynamics of homogeneous clusters, incorporating different functional forms for cell proliferation and cluster splitting. We then extend these models to describe the formation of heterogeneous cell clusters by considering both cluster size and phenotypic composition. We fit the models to experimental data, using a Bayesian framework to perform parameter inference and information criteria to perform model selection. In this way, we characterise and quantify differences in the clustering behaviour of two melanoma phenotypes in homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters, particularly the cluster coagulation, proliferation, and splitting rates. We find that the coagulation rate for the invasive phenotype is much larger than that for the proliferative phenotype, and evaluate how well different modelling assumptions fit the data in order to increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving metastasis. In future work, the models will be used to inform further experiments and, in particular, to suggest and test strategies for inhibiting metastasis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Predicting Treatment Outcomes from Adaptive Therapy - A New Mathematical Biomarker<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Adaptive therapy (AT) protocols have been introduced to combat drug-resistance in cancer, and are characterized by breaks in maximum tolerated dose treatment (the current standard of care in most clinical settings). These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. Promising clinical results in prostate cancer indicate the potential of adaptive treatment protocols, but demonstrate broad heterogeneity in patient response. This naturally leads to the question: why does this heterogeneity occur, and is a `one-size-fits-all' protocol best for patients across this spectrum of responses?  Using a Lotka-Volterra representation of drug-sensitive and -resistant tumor populations' dynamics, we obtain a predictive expression for the expected benefit from Adaptive Therapy and show that this can identify the best responders in a clinical dataset. Building on prior theoretical analyses, we obtain an analytic expression for the optimal treatment strategy, based on individual patient tumor dynamics. In contrast to prior approaches, this strategy also accounts for clinical limitations such as fixed time intervals between clinical appointments, to produce clinically realistic treatment strategies. We show that this strategy varies significantly between patients, and present a framework to generate individual treatment schedules from a patient's initial treatment data. Finally, we develop metrics (‘mathematical biomarkers’) to predict which patients have the greatest sensitivity to unplanned schedule changes, such as delayed appointments, allowing clinicians to identify high-risk patients that need to be monitored more closely and potentially more frequently. Overall, the proposed mathematical biomarkers illustrate the potential of analytic approaches to improve personalised cancer care.

      <strong>Title:</strong> A Multiorgan and Genuinely Hybrid 3D Cancer Metastasis Model over Virtual Patient Framework <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
       Cancer invasion is a hallmark of malignancy, driven by the ability of cancer cells to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and infiltrate surrounding tissues. This process is central to tumour progression and metastasis and involves complex interactions among cancer cells, ECM components, matrix-degrading enzymes, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a key phenotypic shift enabling cancer cells to transition from a proliferative epithelial state to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype.    In this presentation, we introduce a suite of 3D mathematical models that capture the proliferation of epithelial-like cancer cells (ECs) and the invasion strategies of mesenchymal-like cancer cells (MCs). We begin with simplified models, discussing the existence and properties of classical solutions, before advancing to a multiscale hybrid stochastic-deterministic (SDE-PDE) framework with predictive capacity in realistic experimental settings. We conclude by presenting recent extensions of our model towards a multi-organ cancer invasion framework, outlining our initial steps in developing a mathematical foundation for a virtual cancer patient.    This presentation is based on joint works with M. Chaplain, A. Madzvamuse, N. Harbour, T. Williams, L. Franssen, C. Verbeeck, Ch. Surulescu, N. Kolbe, and D. Katsaounis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Mathematical modelling of tendon damage <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Tendons are connective tissues between muscle and bone. Tendinopathy is a common and painful pathology of the tendon affecting all ages, characterised by changes in its structure and composition. We aim to build a mathematical model to elucidate how altered tendon structure affects its function. Tendons are made up of 50-70% water and a collagen-heavy solid matrix, and undergo large deformations. We present a non-linear poroelastic model, assuming Darcy flow through the pores of the solid skeleton, to capture the bulk mechanics of the tissue. The solid skeleton is assumed to be formed primarily of crimped collagen fibrils that only bear load once fully taut, embedded in an isotropic background matrix. To model this, we derive a strain energy density for the solid skeleton assuming the fibrils are individually Hookean and the background matrix is neo-Hookean. We apply a uniaxial cyclic stress or displacement at the muscle boundary, and assume the bone is rigid and impermeable. We explore the effect of tendon damage by considering modifications to the solid constitutive law, such as altering collagen stiffness, fibril crimp angle and distribution, and determine how this affects the bulk poroelastic response of the tissue.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modelling the mechanics of material replacement in biological systems <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Many biological systems contain material components that are repaired and replaced over time by accompanying cells. One common example is the extra-cellular matrix, an interconnected network of proteins that provides chemical and mechanical protection and support in many systems, such as tissue basement membranes and bacterial biofilms. Questions remain as to how the bulk mechanical properties of the material depend on cell maintenance. I will present a mathematical model of a system of springs that aims to capture how the microscale replacement of elastic material can give rise to different observed bulk mechanical behaviours. Despite the model’s simplicity, it has a number of interesting characteristics that are biologically-relevant.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modelling the impact of airway secretions on respiratory dynamics using ventilator waveforms <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      A mechanistic compartmental model is developed to investigate the impact of airway secretion accumulation and its removal on respiratory dynamics in mechanically ventilated patients. The model incorporates airway resistances, lung and chest wall compliances, and simulates patient effort through a respiratory muscle pressure generating term, capturing key patient ventilator interactions. The model, when validated with clinical ventilator waveform data, reveals distinct changes in waveform patterns, such as reduced inspiratory flow and prolonged expiration associated with secretion accumulation. To explore the clinical relevance of these findings, ventilator waveform recordings from 35 patients were analysed before and after airway clearance. The distributions of waveform features, identified by the model as sensitive to secretion accumulation, were compared using Wasserstein distance to quantify changes before and after secretion clearance. These features, when used in unsupervised clustering, revealed distinct patient clusters corresponding to low, medium, and high secretion burden. Our model-informed approach underscores the influence of secretion-induced changes on ventilation dynamics and highlights the potential of waveform-based analysis for real-time, non-invasive secretion monitoring and personalized respiratory care.

      <strong>Title:</strong> The importance of being subcritical - hysteresis and Maxwell equal-energy criteria in biological pattern formation  <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      In this talk I shall survey recent work by myself and collaborators on an alternative view to the classical Turing-pattern view of the onset of pattern in biological systems. The chief context is that of cell polarity formation in which small GTPases that come in inactive cytosolic and active membrane-bound forms. We shall argue that for typical parameter values the symmetry-breaking bifurcation is typically subcritical. The onset of spatial pattern then occurs in a perfect system at the Maxwell point where homogeneous and spatial patterned states have equal values of some notion of energy. The existence of this Maxwell point not only makes spatially localised patterns more prevalent, but also adds additional complexity to the so-called Busse balloon of stable periodic patterns with different wavenumber.  There are additional complexities if timescales are such that protein species are preserved. Then there is a propensity to form polarity through spatial fronts, whose location can be predicted by a novel theory of wave-pinning. Applications are discussed at very different spatial scales, namely plant cell polarity formation and the spatial ecology of desertification and savanna-rainforest transition. The overall conclusion is that biology is likely to favour subcritical bifurcation with its consequent hysteresis as this allows robust, sudden transitions to occur in the presence of slow and/or noisy parameter variation.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Delayed loss of stability of periodic travelling waves affects wavelength changes of patterned ecosystems. <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Many patterned ecosystems, such as dryland vegetation patterns and intertidal mussel beds can be described by PDEs admitting periodic travelling waves (PTWs). Under a changing environment that increases stress, such systems undergo a cascade of wavelength changes before an extinction event occurs. Classically, wavelength changes have been predicted by identifying the intersection of a PTW’s wavelength contour with a stability boundary in the system’s Busse balloon. In this talk, I highlight that this information is often insufficient because of a delayed loss of stability phenomenon. I show that PTWs can persist as transients for ecologically significant times after the crossing of a stability boundary in the Busse balloon. I present a method that can predict the order of magnitude of the time delay between the crossing of a stability boundary and the occurrence of a wavelength change by linking the delay to features of the essential spectra of the PTWs.

      <strong>Title:</strong> The role of mutants in the progression of inflammatory bowel disease: three classes of permanent form travelling waves <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Despite its high prevalence and impact on the lives of those affected, a complete understanding of the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. We investigate a novel mechanism which proposes that mutant epithelial cells are significant to the progression of IBD since they promote inflammation and are resistant to death. We develop a simple model encapsulating the propagation of mutant epithelial cells and immune cells which results from interactions with the intestinal barrier and bacteria. Motivated by the slow growth of mutant epithelial cells, and relatively slow response rate of the adaptive immune system, we combine geometric singular perturbation theory with matched asymptotic expansions to determine the one-dimensional slow invariant manifold that characterises the leading order dynamics at all times beyond a passive initial adjustment phase. The dynamics on this manifold are controlled by a bifurcation parameter, which depends on the ratio of growth to decay rates of all components except mutants and determines three distinct classes of permanent-form travelling waves that describe the propagation of mutant epithelial and immune cells.  These are obtained from scalar reaction-diffusion equations with the reaction being (i) a bistable nonlinearity with a cut-off, (ii) a cubic Fisher nonlinearity and (iii) a KPP or Fisher nonlinearity. Our results suggest that mutant epithelial cells are critical to the progression of IBD.  However, their effect on the speed of progression is subdominant.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Epidemiological models are crucial for informing policies aimed at reducing disease spread, both within indoor environments and across larger populations. At the population level (macroscale), network models can be used to understand and predict disease transmission. However, inferring key disease spread properties—such as time to infection, reproduction number—from data presents significant challenges. These include: (a) the evolving nature of network structures, (b) the quantity and quality of available data, and (c) the method by which data is extracted. A notable challenge is size bias, where highly connected individuals are more likely to be sampled, skewing the data. To investigate and mitigate this bias, we compared two data extraction methods: the Random Walk (RW) and the Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW), quantifying the extent of size bias in each approach.    </div>

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modeling and sensitivity analysis of Salmonella Transmission via Environmental, Foodborne, and Vector Pathways <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Salmonella is a significant zoonotic pathogen responsible for numerous foodborne diseases worldwide. Its transmission occurs through the consumption of contaminated animal- and plant-derived foods, as well as environmental and vector-mediated pathways. In this study, we develop a mathematical model based on a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations to describe the transmission dynamics of Salmonella across these pathways. The model accounts for direct human-to-human transmission, contamination via food and water sources, and vector-borne spread. We analyze the basic properties of the model, including equilibrium points, positivity, and boundedness of solutions. The basic reproduction number (R₀) is derived using the next-generation matrix method, providing insights into transmission dynamics. Stability analysis is conducted to determine the conditions for disease persistence and eradication. The model is calibrated using European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) data on Salmonellosis cases from 2007–2023, where some parameters are assumed while some are fitted using the package SciPy.optimize of the SciPy 1.15.1 library in Python 3.13.1. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most influential parameters affecting disease transmission. Additionally, optimal control strategies are investigated, incorporating interventions such as improved sanitation, food safety regulations, and vector control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of various control measures, providing a quantitative assessment of their impact on reducing Salmonellosis prevalence. The study also addresses challenges in numerical implementation, ensuring stable and accurate solutions. Our findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials, aiding in the optimization of resource allocation for Salmonellosis prevention and control in the EU/EEA.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      We set up and analyse a mathematical model, the Serious Crime Model, which describes the interaction of mild and serious offenders and potential criminals. However we get more complete results for a simpler version of this model, the Mild Crime Model, with no serious offenders. For the full Serious Crime Model there are two key parameters R_0^1 and R_0^2, corresponding to the basic reproduction number in the mathematics of infectious diseases, which determine the behaviour of the system. For the simpler Mild Crime Model there is one such parameter R_0^1. Both forward and backward bifurcation can occur for this second model with two subcritical non-trivial equilibria possible for R_0 < 1 in the backward case. For backwards bifurcation there is another threshold value R_0^* such that the upper non-trivial equilibrium is unstable for R_0^1 < R_0^* and stable for R_0^1 > R_0^*. For forwards bifurcation there are two threshold values R_0^* and R_0^** such that the unique endemic equilibrium is stable for R_0^** < R_0^1 < R_0^* and stable for R_0^1 > R_0^*. At the end we return to the Full Serious Crime Model and discuss the behaviour of this model. The results are meaningful and interesting because in all of the other epidemiological and sociological models of which we are aware, analogous thresholds to R_0^* and R_0^** do not exist. For forwards bifurcation the unique non-trivial equilibrium and for backwards bifurcation with two subcritical equilibria the higher nontrivial equilibrium are also usually always locally asymptotically stable. So our models exhibit interesting and unusual behaviour.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      A pivotal aspect of developing effective immunotherapies for solid tumours is the robust testing of product efficacy inside in vitro platforms.Collaborating with an experimental team that developed a novel microfluidic device at Children’s National Hospital (CNH), we developed a mathematical model to investigate immune cell migration and cytotoxicity within the device.  Specifically, we study Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell migration inside the channels, treating the cell as a moving boundary driven by a chemoattractant concentration gradient. The chemoattractant concentration is governed by two partial differential equations (PDEs) that incorporate key geometric elements of the device. We examine the motion of the cell as a function of its occlusion of the channel and find that certain cell shapes allow for multiple cells to travel inside the channel simultaneously. Additionally, we identify parameter regimes under which cells clog the channel, impairing their movement. All our findings are validated against experimental data provided by CNH. We integrate our model results into a broader model of the device, which also examines the cytotoxicity of CAR T-cells. This provides a tool for distinguishing experimental artefacts from genuine CAR T-cell behaviour. This collaboration enabled the team at Children’s National Hospital to refine experimental conditions and uncover mechanisms enhancing CAR T-cell efficacy.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and most common primary brain tumour in adults and is uniformly fatal, with a poor median survival time of 15 months. Standard of care for GBM consist of radiotherapy either alone or following surgical resection, despite this, radio-resistance almost always occurs making recurrence inevitable. Failure of the current standard of care has been partly attributed to a special sub-population, the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which initiate and drive tumour growth. Treatment cannot be successful unless all GSCs are eliminated. However, GSCs are known to be highly resistant to radiotherapy, and complete surgical removal is impossible in GBM. Therefore, new treatments that specifically target GSCs could have a potentially large benefit. BMP4 has been shown to induce differentiation of GSCs towards a less malignant, astrocytic-like (ALCs) lineage reversing the GSC state and reducing radio-resistance. We develop a data driven mechanistic mathematical model that accounts for the GSCs, tumour cells (TCs) and ALCs as well as their response to both radiotherapy and BMP4 induced differentiation therapy. We parameterise our model based on data collected from twelve GSC cell lines, that underwent various BMP4 and radiotherapy treatments. Through virtual clinical trials we determine an optimal dosing strategy for BMP4 in combination with radiotherapy. We identify several key parameters that impact the efficacy of BMP4 therapy including radiosensitivity and proliferation rate. These parameters can be used to strategically select candidates for real clinical trials that will likely have the largest benefit.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a tumour microenvironment (TME) that plays a crucial role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. The architectural organisation of TMEs exhibits significant spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity, but how these structures emerge from dynamic intercellular interactions remains poorly understood. Mathematical modelling offers a powerful approach to explore the mechanistic basis of these emergent properties, providing insights beyond what can be directly observed through temporally sparse sampling and descriptive analyses of tumours. Here, we present a spatially explicit, multi-scale agent-based model that simulates the dynamic crosstalk between Pancreatic Cancer Cells (PCC) and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAF), incorporating key signalling pathways and phenotypic transitions. The model, parameterised using single-cell transcriptomics, captures the spatio-temporal evolution of PCC-CAF interactions under varying initial conditions of cell abundance and spatial organisation. Simulations reveal that both the proportions and spatial configurations of cell populations influence the emergent phenotypic composition and dynamic trajectories of co-evolution, highlighting the role of tissue architecture in shaping tumour progression and heterogeneity. In this presentation, we will discuss the mathematical formulation of the model, key simulation results, and ongoing efforts to extend the framework for exploring therapeutic strategies. Our approach demonstrates how mathematical modelling can be leveraged to predict and quantify the influence of hetero-cellular crosstalk and tissue architecture on shaping phenotypic heterogeneity within the tumour ecosystem in PDAC.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many lymphocytes without further differentiation into mature blood cells. The primary treatment for most ALL cases is chemotherapy; however, after the intense treatment phase, relapse is observed in some patients. Early-stage relapses might be due to some remaining leukemia cells not being detectable by conventional cytomorphology. The molecular tests on minimal residual disease (MRD) can quantify disease burden at relatively low levels, thus helping track cancer remission and relapse. We investigated the dynamics of residual disease to describe the observed response and relapse kinetics heterogeneity. We developed stochastic, patient-specific models based on longitudinal MRD data to further the understanding of the driving factors of relapse, aiming to quantify better prediction of likelihood and timing of relapse in individual patients based on individual treatment choices.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      The specification of discrete cell states in developing tissues is driven by biological signals that force the cells to modify their molecular identity and transition to a new state. This process is well illustrated by Waddington’s landscape metaphor, which portrays a cell on its developmental pathway as a ball rolling down a landscape of branching valleys. The local minima of the landscape represent “attractor states" whose existence depends on the signals that continuously reshape the landscape making it highly dynamical.  We present a systematic approach, grounded in dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, to construct dynamical landscape models from high dimensional transcriptomic data.  The approach uses computational methods to identify attractor states and the pathways connecting them thereby revealing the complex topology of the cells decision-making landscapes. We apply this framework to in vitro data from the developing neural tube, where distinct types of neural progenitors are specified in response to pulses of the signal Sonic Hedgehog. The resulting quantitative model successfully replicates cells responses when subjected to signal perturbations and can be used to predict in vitro protocols for generating specific cell types.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      An important early step in mammalian embryonic development is the specification of the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes of the embryo. The axial midline is a central stripe-like pattern that runs along the anteroposterior axis, providing signals that structure the body plan and position developing internal organs. Despite the midline being a critical component of embryonic development, little is known about the mechanism of its specification. Gastruloids, which are embryo-like 3D stem cell aggregates, self-organise to create all 3 embryonic axes, are more amenable to experimentation than mouse embryos, and form a midline stripe at 120hAA (after aggregation). Our analysis of published scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets on mouse gastruloids has identified 3 crucial signalling modules to be active from early symmetry breaking (72-96hAA) to midline specification (96h-120hAA). We hypothesise that a GRN comprising key genes from some or all these signalling modules govern both early symmetry breaking and axial midline specification. We model the gastruloid as a 2D sheet of nuclei and examine the parameter space of all possible GRN topologies, which when coupled with directed cell movements, successfully achieve symmetry breaking.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Deciphering tempo control in embryo development through dynamical system theory <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Embryo development is driven by precise gene expression timing, which varies across species. While molecular mechanisms controlling this timing are being intensely studied, the integration of tempo control into mathematical models remains underexplored. In this chalk talk, I will present a new mathematical framework linking gene expression orbits to developmental programs, allowing us to identify tempo changes as dynamical system perturbations that preserve the function of the system.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Positional information theory <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      We study the positional information conferred by the morphogens Sonic Hedgehog and BMP in neural tube patterning.  We use the mathematics of information theory to quantify the information that cells use to decide their fate.  We study the encoding, recoding and decoding that take place as the morphogen gradient is formed, triggers a nuclear response and determines cell fates using a gene regulatory network.
