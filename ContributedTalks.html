      <strong>Title:</strong> Mechanistic modelling of cluster formation in metastatic melanoma<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, yet survival rates are excellent if it is diagnosed early. However, if metastasis occurs, five-year survival rates drop significantly. During the early stages of tumour initiation, melanoma cells form clusters within the primary tumour which promote metastasis. In the absence of biological tools to visualise cluster formation at primary tumour sites, we develop mathematical models to generate mechanistic insight into their formation. For this work we utilise in vitro data for two distinct melanoma cell phenotypes, one more proliferative and the other more invasive. This data consists of experiments for each phenotype individually, resulting in homogeneous clusters, as well as mixtures of the two phenotypes, resulting in heterogeneous clusters. We develop a series of differential-equation-based models using a coagulation-fragmentation-proliferation framework to describe the growth dynamics of homogeneous clusters, incorporating different functional forms for cell proliferation and cluster splitting. We then extend these models to describe the formation of heterogeneous cell clusters by considering both cluster size and phenotypic composition. We fit the models to experimental data, using a Bayesian framework to perform parameter inference and information criteria to perform model selection. In this way, we characterise and quantify differences in the clustering behaviour of two melanoma phenotypes in homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters, particularly the cluster coagulation, proliferation, and splitting rates. We find that the coagulation rate for the invasive phenotype is much larger than that for the proliferative phenotype, and evaluate how well different modelling assumptions fit the data in order to increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving metastasis. In future work, the models will be used to inform further experiments and, in particular, to suggest and test strategies for inhibiting metastasis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Predicting Treatment Outcomes from Adaptive Therapy - A New Mathematical Biomarker<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Adaptive therapy (AT) protocols have been introduced to combat drug-resistance in cancer, and are characterized by breaks in maximum tolerated dose treatment (the current standard of care in most clinical settings). These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. Promising clinical results in prostate cancer indicate the potential of adaptive treatment protocols, but demonstrate broad heterogeneity in patient response. This naturally leads to the question: why does this heterogeneity occur, and is a `one-size-fits-all' protocol best for patients across this spectrum of responses?  Using a Lotka-Volterra representation of drug-sensitive and -resistant tumor populations' dynamics, we obtain a predictive expression for the expected benefit from Adaptive Therapy and show that this can identify the best responders in a clinical dataset. Building on prior theoretical analyses, we obtain an analytic expression for the optimal treatment strategy, based on individual patient tumor dynamics. In contrast to prior approaches, this strategy also accounts for clinical limitations such as fixed time intervals between clinical appointments, to produce clinically realistic treatment strategies. We show that this strategy varies significantly between patients, and present a framework to generate individual treatment schedules from a patient's initial treatment data. Finally, we develop metrics (‘mathematical biomarkers’) to predict which patients have the greatest sensitivity to unplanned schedule changes, such as delayed appointments, allowing clinicians to identify high-risk patients that need to be monitored more closely and potentially more frequently. Overall, the proposed mathematical biomarkers illustrate the potential of analytic approaches to improve personalised cancer care.

      <strong>Title:</strong> A Multiorgan and Genuinely Hybrid 3D Cancer Metastasis Model over Virtual Patient Framework <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
       Cancer invasion is a hallmark of malignancy, driven by the ability of cancer cells to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and infiltrate surrounding tissues. This process is central to tumour progression and metastasis and involves complex interactions among cancer cells, ECM components, matrix-degrading enzymes, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a key phenotypic shift enabling cancer cells to transition from a proliferative epithelial state to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype.    In this presentation, we introduce a suite of 3D mathematical models that capture the proliferation of epithelial-like cancer cells (ECs) and the invasion strategies of mesenchymal-like cancer cells (MCs). We begin with simplified models, discussing the existence and properties of classical solutions, before advancing to a multiscale hybrid stochastic-deterministic (SDE-PDE) framework with predictive capacity in realistic experimental settings. We conclude by presenting recent extensions of our model towards a multi-organ cancer invasion framework, outlining our initial steps in developing a mathematical foundation for a virtual cancer patient.    This presentation is based on joint works with M. Chaplain, A. Madzvamuse, N. Harbour, T. Williams, L. Franssen, C. Verbeeck, Ch. Surulescu, N. Kolbe, and D. Katsaounis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Mathematical modelling of tendon damage <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Tendons are connective tissues between muscle and bone. Tendinopathy is a common and painful pathology of the tendon affecting all ages, characterised by changes in its structure and composition. We aim to build a mathematical model to elucidate how altered tendon structure affects its function. Tendons are made up of 50-70% water and a collagen-heavy solid matrix, and undergo large deformations. We present a non-linear poroelastic model, assuming Darcy flow through the pores of the solid skeleton, to capture the bulk mechanics of the tissue. The solid skeleton is assumed to be formed primarily of crimped collagen fibrils that only bear load once fully taut, embedded in an isotropic background matrix. To model this, we derive a strain energy density for the solid skeleton assuming the fibrils are individually Hookean and the background matrix is neo-Hookean. We apply a uniaxial cyclic stress or displacement at the muscle boundary, and assume the bone is rigid and impermeable. We explore the effect of tendon damage by considering modifications to the solid constitutive law, such as altering collagen stiffness, fibril crimp angle and distribution, and determine how this affects the bulk poroelastic response of the tissue.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modelling the mechanics of material replacement in biological systems <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Many biological systems contain material components that are repaired and replaced over time by accompanying cells. One common example is the extra-cellular matrix, an interconnected network of proteins that provides chemical and mechanical protection and support in many systems, such as tissue basement membranes and bacterial biofilms. Questions remain as to how the bulk mechanical properties of the material depend on cell maintenance. I will present a mathematical model of a system of springs that aims to capture how the microscale replacement of elastic material can give rise to different observed bulk mechanical behaviours. Despite the model’s simplicity, it has a number of interesting characteristics that are biologically-relevant.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modelling the impact of airway secretions on respiratory dynamics using ventilator waveforms <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      A mechanistic compartmental model is developed to investigate the impact of airway secretion accumulation and its removal on respiratory dynamics in mechanically ventilated patients. The model incorporates airway resistances, lung and chest wall compliances, and simulates patient effort through a respiratory muscle pressure generating term, capturing key patient ventilator interactions. The model, when validated with clinical ventilator waveform data, reveals distinct changes in waveform patterns, such as reduced inspiratory flow and prolonged expiration associated with secretion accumulation. To explore the clinical relevance of these findings, ventilator waveform recordings from 35 patients were analysed before and after airway clearance. The distributions of waveform features, identified by the model as sensitive to secretion accumulation, were compared using Wasserstein distance to quantify changes before and after secretion clearance. These features, when used in unsupervised clustering, revealed distinct patient clusters corresponding to low, medium, and high secretion burden. Our model-informed approach underscores the influence of secretion-induced changes on ventilation dynamics and highlights the potential of waveform-based analysis for real-time, non-invasive secretion monitoring and personalized respiratory care.

      <strong>Title:</strong> The importance of being subcritical - hysteresis and Maxwell equal-energy criteria in biological pattern formation  <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      In this talk I shall survey recent work by myself and collaborators on an alternative view to the classical Turing-pattern view of the onset of pattern in biological systems. The chief context is that of cell polarity formation in which small GTPases that come in inactive cytosolic and active membrane-bound forms. We shall argue that for typical parameter values the symmetry-breaking bifurcation is typically subcritical. The onset of spatial pattern then occurs in a perfect system at the Maxwell point where homogeneous and spatial patterned states have equal values of some notion of energy. The existence of this Maxwell point not only makes spatially localised patterns more prevalent, but also adds additional complexity to the so-called Busse balloon of stable periodic patterns with different wavenumber.  There are additional complexities if timescales are such that protein species are preserved. Then there is a propensity to form polarity through spatial fronts, whose location can be predicted by a novel theory of wave-pinning. Applications are discussed at very different spatial scales, namely plant cell polarity formation and the spatial ecology of desertification and savanna-rainforest transition. The overall conclusion is that biology is likely to favour subcritical bifurcation with its consequent hysteresis as this allows robust, sudden transitions to occur in the presence of slow and/or noisy parameter variation.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Delayed loss of stability of periodic travelling waves affects wavelength changes of patterned ecosystems. <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Many patterned ecosystems, such as dryland vegetation patterns and intertidal mussel beds can be described by PDEs admitting periodic travelling waves (PTWs). Under a changing environment that increases stress, such systems undergo a cascade of wavelength changes before an extinction event occurs. Classically, wavelength changes have been predicted by identifying the intersection of a PTW’s wavelength contour with a stability boundary in the system’s Busse balloon. In this talk, I highlight that this information is often insufficient because of a delayed loss of stability phenomenon. I show that PTWs can persist as transients for ecologically significant times after the crossing of a stability boundary in the Busse balloon. I present a method that can predict the order of magnitude of the time delay between the crossing of a stability boundary and the occurrence of a wavelength change by linking the delay to features of the essential spectra of the PTWs.

      <strong>Title:</strong> The role of mutants in the progression of inflammatory bowel disease: three classes of permanent form travelling waves <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Despite its high prevalence and impact on the lives of those affected, a complete understanding of the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. We investigate a novel mechanism which proposes that mutant epithelial cells are significant to the progression of IBD since they promote inflammation and are resistant to death. We develop a simple model encapsulating the propagation of mutant epithelial cells and immune cells which results from interactions with the intestinal barrier and bacteria. Motivated by the slow growth of mutant epithelial cells, and relatively slow response rate of the adaptive immune system, we combine geometric singular perturbation theory with matched asymptotic expansions to determine the one-dimensional slow invariant manifold that characterises the leading order dynamics at all times beyond a passive initial adjustment phase. The dynamics on this manifold are controlled by a bifurcation parameter, which depends on the ratio of growth to decay rates of all components except mutants and determines three distinct classes of permanent-form travelling waves that describe the propagation of mutant epithelial and immune cells.  These are obtained from scalar reaction-diffusion equations with the reaction being (i) a bistable nonlinearity with a cut-off, (ii) a cubic Fisher nonlinearity and (iii) a KPP or Fisher nonlinearity. Our results suggest that mutant epithelial cells are critical to the progression of IBD.  However, their effect on the speed of progression is subdominant.

      <strong>Title:</strong> From Rooms to Countries: Tackling Mesoscale and Macroscale Challenges in Zoonotic Epidemic Modelling  <br/>

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Epidemiological models are crucial for informing policies aimed at reducing disease spread, both within indoor environments and across larger populations. At the population level (macroscale), network models can be used to understand and predict disease transmission. However, inferring key disease spread properties—such as time to infection, reproduction number—from data presents significant challenges. These include: (a) the evolving nature of network structures, (b) the quantity and quality of available data, and (c) the method by which data is extracted. A notable challenge is size bias, where highly connected individuals are more likely to be sampled, skewing the data. To investigate and mitigate this bias, we compared two data extraction methods: the Random Walk (RW) and the Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW), quantifying the extent of size bias in each approach.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Modeling and sensitivity analysis of Salmonella Transmission via Environmental, Foodborne, and Vector Pathways <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Salmonella is a significant zoonotic pathogen responsible for numerous foodborne diseases worldwide. Its transmission occurs through the consumption of contaminated animal- and plant-derived foods, as well as environmental and vector-mediated pathways. In this study, we develop a mathematical model based on a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations to describe the transmission dynamics of Salmonella across these pathways. The model accounts for direct human-to-human transmission, contamination via food and water sources, and vector-borne spread. We analyze the basic properties of the model, including equilibrium points, positivity, and boundedness of solutions. The basic reproduction number (R₀) is derived using the next-generation matrix method, providing insights into transmission dynamics. Stability analysis is conducted to determine the conditions for disease persistence and eradication. The model is calibrated using European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) data on Salmonellosis cases from 2007–2023, where some parameters are assumed while some are fitted using the package SciPy.optimize of the SciPy 1.15.1 library in Python 3.13.1. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most influential parameters affecting disease transmission. Additionally, optimal control strategies are investigated, incorporating interventions such as improved sanitation, food safety regulations, and vector control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of various control measures, providing a quantitative assessment of their impact on reducing Salmonellosis prevalence. The study also addresses challenges in numerical implementation, ensuring stable and accurate solutions. Our findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials, aiding in the optimization of resource allocation for Salmonellosis prevention and control in the EU/EEA.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      We set up and analyse a mathematical model, the Serious Crime Model, which describes the interaction of mild and serious offenders and potential criminals. However we get more complete results for a simpler version of this model, the Mild Crime Model, with no serious offenders. For the full Serious Crime Model there are two key parameters R_0^1 and R_0^2, corresponding to the basic reproduction number in the mathematics of infectious diseases, which determine the behaviour of the system. For the simpler Mild Crime Model there is one such parameter R_0^1. Both forward and backward bifurcation can occur for this second model with two subcritical non-trivial equilibria possible for R_0 < 1 in the backward case. For backwards bifurcation there is another threshold value R_0^* such that the upper non-trivial equilibrium is unstable for R_0^1 < R_0^* and stable for R_0^1 > R_0^*. For forwards bifurcation there are two threshold values R_0^* and R_0^** such that the unique endemic equilibrium is stable for R_0^** < R_0^1 < R_0^* and stable for R_0^1 > R_0^*. At the end we return to the Full Serious Crime Model and discuss the behaviour of this model. The results are meaningful and interesting because in all of the other epidemiological and sociological models of which we are aware, analogous thresholds to R_0^* and R_0^** do not exist. For forwards bifurcation the unique non-trivial equilibrium and for backwards bifurcation with two subcritical equilibria the higher nontrivial equilibrium are also usually always locally asymptotically stable. So our models exhibit interesting and unusual behaviour.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      A pivotal aspect of developing effective immunotherapies for solid tumours is the robust testing of product efficacy inside in vitro platforms.Collaborating with an experimental team that developed a novel microfluidic device at Children’s National Hospital (CNH), we developed a mathematical model to investigate immune cell migration and cytotoxicity within the device.  Specifically, we study Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell migration inside the channels, treating the cell as a moving boundary driven by a chemoattractant concentration gradient. The chemoattractant concentration is governed by two partial differential equations (PDEs) that incorporate key geometric elements of the device. We examine the motion of the cell as a function of its occlusion of the channel and find that certain cell shapes allow for multiple cells to travel inside the channel simultaneously. Additionally, we identify parameter regimes under which cells clog the channel, impairing their movement. All our findings are validated against experimental data provided by CNH. We integrate our model results into a broader model of the device, which also examines the cytotoxicity of CAR T-cells. This provides a tool for distinguishing experimental artefacts from genuine CAR T-cell behaviour. This collaboration enabled the team at Children’s National Hospital to refine experimental conditions and uncover mechanisms enhancing CAR T-cell efficacy.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and most common primary brain tumour in adults and is uniformly fatal, with a poor median survival time of 15 months. Standard of care for GBM consist of radiotherapy either alone or following surgical resection, despite this, radio-resistance almost always occurs making recurrence inevitable. Failure of the current standard of care has been partly attributed to a special sub-population, the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which initiate and drive tumour growth. Treatment cannot be successful unless all GSCs are eliminated. However, GSCs are known to be highly resistant to radiotherapy, and complete surgical removal is impossible in GBM. Therefore, new treatments that specifically target GSCs could have a potentially large benefit. BMP4 has been shown to induce differentiation of GSCs towards a less malignant, astrocytic-like (ALCs) lineage reversing the GSC state and reducing radio-resistance. We develop a data driven mechanistic mathematical model that accounts for the GSCs, tumour cells (TCs) and ALCs as well as their response to both radiotherapy and BMP4 induced differentiation therapy. We parameterise our model based on data collected from twelve GSC cell lines, that underwent various BMP4 and radiotherapy treatments. Through virtual clinical trials we determine an optimal dosing strategy for BMP4 in combination with radiotherapy. We identify several key parameters that impact the efficacy of BMP4 therapy including radiosensitivity and proliferation rate. These parameters can be used to strategically select candidates for real clinical trials that will likely have the largest benefit.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a tumour microenvironment (TME) that plays a crucial role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. The architectural organisation of TMEs exhibits significant spatial and phenotypic heterogeneity, but how these structures emerge from dynamic intercellular interactions remains poorly understood. Mathematical modelling offers a powerful approach to explore the mechanistic basis of these emergent properties, providing insights beyond what can be directly observed through temporally sparse sampling and descriptive analyses of tumours. Here, we present a spatially explicit, multi-scale agent-based model that simulates the dynamic crosstalk between Pancreatic Cancer Cells (PCC) and Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAF), incorporating key signalling pathways and phenotypic transitions. The model, parameterised using single-cell transcriptomics, captures the spatio-temporal evolution of PCC-CAF interactions under varying initial conditions of cell abundance and spatial organisation. Simulations reveal that both the proportions and spatial configurations of cell populations influence the emergent phenotypic composition and dynamic trajectories of co-evolution, highlighting the role of tissue architecture in shaping tumour progression and heterogeneity. In this presentation, we will discuss the mathematical formulation of the model, key simulation results, and ongoing efforts to extend the framework for exploring therapeutic strategies. Our approach demonstrates how mathematical modelling can be leveraged to predict and quantify the influence of hetero-cellular crosstalk and tissue architecture on shaping phenotypic heterogeneity within the tumour ecosystem in PDAC.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow produces too many lymphocytes without further differentiation into mature blood cells. The primary treatment for most ALL cases is chemotherapy; however, after the intense treatment phase, relapse is observed in some patients. Early-stage relapses might be due to some remaining leukemia cells not being detectable by conventional cytomorphology. The molecular tests on minimal residual disease (MRD) can quantify disease burden at relatively low levels, thus helping track cancer remission and relapse. We investigated the dynamics of residual disease to describe the observed response and relapse kinetics heterogeneity. We developed stochastic, patient-specific models based on longitudinal MRD data to further the understanding of the driving factors of relapse, aiming to quantify better prediction of likelihood and timing of relapse in individual patients based on individual treatment choices.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      The specification of discrete cell states in developing tissues is driven by biological signals that force the cells to modify their molecular identity and transition to a new state. This process is well illustrated by Waddington’s landscape metaphor, which portrays a cell on its developmental pathway as a ball rolling down a landscape of branching valleys. The local minima of the landscape represent “attractor states" whose existence depends on the signals that continuously reshape the landscape making it highly dynamical.  We present a systematic approach, grounded in dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, to construct dynamical landscape models from high dimensional transcriptomic data.  The approach uses computational methods to identify attractor states and the pathways connecting them thereby revealing the complex topology of the cells decision-making landscapes. We apply this framework to in vitro data from the developing neural tube, where distinct types of neural progenitors are specified in response to pulses of the signal Sonic Hedgehog. The resulting quantitative model successfully replicates cells responses when subjected to signal perturbations and can be used to predict in vitro protocols for generating specific cell types.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      An important early step in mammalian embryonic development is the specification of the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes of the embryo. The axial midline is a central stripe-like pattern that runs along the anteroposterior axis, providing signals that structure the body plan and position developing internal organs. Despite the midline being a critical component of embryonic development, little is known about the mechanism of its specification. Gastruloids, which are embryo-like 3D stem cell aggregates, self-organise to create all 3 embryonic axes, are more amenable to experimentation than mouse embryos, and form a midline stripe at 120hAA (after aggregation). Our analysis of published scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets on mouse gastruloids has identified 3 crucial signalling modules to be active from early symmetry breaking (72-96hAA) to midline specification (96h-120hAA). We hypothesise that a GRN comprising key genes from some or all these signalling modules govern both early symmetry breaking and axial midline specification. We model the gastruloid as a 2D sheet of nuclei and examine the parameter space of all possible GRN topologies, which when coupled with directed cell movements, successfully achieve symmetry breaking.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological condition, currently affecting 10 million people worldwide, with this number set to double by 2050. Treatment for PD focuses predominantly on pharmacological interventions. When these become ineffective, an alternative can be provided by the deep brain stimulation (DBS). In DBS, electrical leads are implanted in a patient’s brain and a high frequency-low amplitude current is delivered to the brain, usually at the same setting throughout the day and night. Although the treatment can be life changing, its effectiveness is still limited and the mechanisms behind its positive effect remain unknown In this talk, we discuss the brain oscillations characteristic to Parkinson’s disease and present an approach to modelling the effect of stimulation using a Wilson-Cowan framework. Stimulation is applied as a forcing term, making the model non-autonomous. We find that depending on the dynamical regime, the model either behaves as a driven or an entrained system. In the entrained case, we consider a non-smooth limit, which brings insight on how entrainment occurs. Overall, our work contributes to understanding how brain stimulation can be used to alter brain rhythms, in particular suppressing the pathological oscillations and promoting healthy ones. Insights from studies on PD might further prove useful for other therapies such as epilepsy.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Connectivity is one signature of brain function. Connectivity may be structural, as measured by looking at images of the brain and measuring the white matter pathways (tracts). Connectivity may also be functional, measuring the extent to which different areas of the brain share information over time. Here, we consider functional connectivity (FC) as computed from pairwise correlations between recordings from different electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes.  We consider people living with mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as age-matched healthy controls and evaluate the extent to which FC evaluated from overnight recordings during sleep distinguish between the two groups. Previous work has focussed on FC during wake, but its variation during sleep remains underexplored.  We used gold-standard polysomnographic recordings collected at the Surrey Sleep Research Centre based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine standard low-density EEG montage with six electrodes for one full night of sleep. Data from 20 people living with mild AD, 12 of their partners and 42 healthy controls were used. FC was computed across vigilance states and frequency bands using two reproducible techniques: phase lag index and weighted phase lag index.  Previous studies performed during wake find that FC is lower in AD than in healthy controls. We find the converse during sleep, i.e. that FC is consistently higher in AD than in controls.  The theta (4-8Hz) and delta (0.5-4Hz) bands in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep provide the highest discriminatory power. Notably, effect sizes in NREM sleep surpass those in wakefulness, highlighting the potential of sleep EEG features as biomarkers for AD.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Neurons often switch between two distinct membrane potentials, known as up and down states, which correspond to depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively. These states are crucial for synaptic inputs integration and consequently neuronal signals generation and propagation. At the population level, the transition between up and down states occurs in a synchronized manner across large networks of neurons, making this transition critical for information processing and memory consolidation. The precise mechanisms that control transitions between up and down states are not fully understood, but they are likely due to neuronal network properties. Here, we propose an organizing center underlying the dynamics of up and down states within neuronal populations, applying bifurcation analysis and simulations of neuronal network models. Our analysis demonstrates that the dynamic structures we reveal are general across established macroscopic models of neural population activity, including the classical Wilson-Cowan and Tsodyks models, underscoring their universality. Our findings provide insight into how this organizing center characterizes distinct qualitative behaviors and its involvement in controlling the balance between excitation and inhibition, which is fundamental to large-scale brain dynamics. We show an example of this phenomenon in on our recently developed medial amygdala circuitry model and explore its broader implications for reproductive function.

To address this gap, we constructed a computational model of a KNDy neuron network incorporating both fast and slow communication. Our findings indicate that fast glutamate signalling may trigger synchronisation, while slower NKB and dynorphin signalling controls the burst duration. This model provides a framework for exploring how network architecture and neurotransmitter interactions influence the generation of GnRH pulses.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Flowers and pollinators have co-evolved over millennia to produce fascinating sensory properties. One such recent discovery was that bees and spiders can detect natural electrical fields. Thus, our attention turns to flowers. Acting as dielectrics, flowers inductively charge in electrical fields. Considering the source as that of charged pollinators or the Earth's background electrical field, we seek to answer: whether flowers use this to their advantage to become more detectable to pollinators? And how does floral geometry (petal shape and number) affect the perturbed field? To investigate this, the electric field interior and exterior to the flower is modelled numerically. A two-dimensional approximation is taken, and a AAA-least squares method used to find a rational approximation of the harmonic electric potential. Some time is spent examining this method; its application to two-domain problems appears to be new. The algorithm gives accurate and rapid results dependent on only three parameters: the relative permittivity of the flower – its ability to store electrical energy - the petal number and the location of the pollinator(s). The results show that flowers display distinct information about their morphology and pollen levels at distance through the perturbed electric field. Pollinators then detect these signals while also sensing other nearby pollinators. Some arthropods, such as the crab spider, may even use the flower to mask their own presence and draw in unsuspecting prey. Results in 3D are also produced using the COMSOL package and show that the 2D results are a good proxy for the overall 3D behaviour.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Multiscale models can help us to understand how organ-scale developmental patterns arise through processes at the cellular scale. Understanding such developmental patterning within growth tissues is a particular challenge. Here we present a multiscale model to investigate hormone gradients within the growth Arabidopsis plant root [1]. The model predicts how the distribution of the hormone gibberellin (GA) depends on the metabolism network, delivery of precursors, passive and active transport between adjacent cellular compartments, and cell growth. Using asymptotic analysis, we derived a continuum approximation of the initial cell-based model which revealed how the effective hormone velocity, diffusivity, and dilution rate depend on the parameters governing the cell-scale processes [2]. Furthermore, the continuum approximation reduced computational costs enabling us to estimate key unknown parameter values using biosensor data.   The model suggested that delivery of a shoot-derived precursor within the elongating cells contributes to the hormone gradient. Model predictions suggested that enzyme inactivation within dividing cells could explain the steep hormone gradients observed in over-expression lines and improves agreement between predictions and data in both wild type and loss-of-function mutants. Furthermore, the model predicted that the hormone gradient also depends on a balance of diffusion through cell-to-cell channels (termed plasmodesmata) and degradation, which we validated via additional biosensor imaging.   In conclusion, our results suggest that local synthesis combined with diffusion and degradation creates a spatial hormone gradient within the plant root that provides positional information and patterns cell elongation.

As part of an interdisciplinary project, we are developing mathematical models to understand how SUMO transduces environmental signals into specific physiological responses. The model incorporates key processes in the SUMO cycle, which involves SUMO proteins performing post-translational modifications on a Target protein. We used the mathematical models composed of systems of non-linear ordinary differential equations to simulate observed changes in SUMO-cycle components after salt, osmotic and flagellin stress in different root tissues (integrating new experimental data generated as part of the SUMOcode project, www.sumocode.org). The model reveals how the different stresses affect the level of SUMOylation in different root tissues.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      For a century and more, mathematicians (notably including Alan Turing) have been explaining Fibonacci numbers within plant forms; for most of this time developmental and molecular biologists have ignored them for their own mostly valid reasons. Here I address one objection, the lack of testable predictions, by presenting the first quantitative evaluation of the ability of Schwendener disk-stacking models to generate the spiral patterns seen in a large dataset of sunflower seedheads. I’ll explain the standard van Iterson theory of lattices on cylinders, which accounts for the observed predominance of Fibonacci counts. But I’ll also show the generalisation to disk- stacking models and how these account for other observed phenomena: a smaller but detectable frequency of Lucas numbers, a comparable frequency of Fibonacci numbers plus or minus one, occurrences of pairs of roughly equal but non-Fibonacci counts, and an occasional lack of rotational symmetry. Moreover the Schwendener model produces these phenomena in the region of parameter space just beyond where the Fibonacci structure breaks down, and also allows an interpretation of apparently noisy observations as a chaotic deterministic dynamical system. The rich dynamics of these conceptually simple models are a fertile area for mathematical study, allow quantitative comparison with existing morphological data, can be related to and generate new hypotheses in molecular biology, and above all provide explanations of complex biological form that cannot be reduced to expression of a single gene. Phyllotaxis (still) has the potential to become a persuasive example of the need for mathematics in developmental biology.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Melanoma cells can transition between cell states, contributing to therapy resistance and immune evasion. These state changes involve dynamic and reversible shifts in gene expression, making it essential to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms for developing effective therapies. We present a mathematical model of a minimal gene regulatory network comprising key transcription factors associated with melanoma cell states. Using deterministic temporal and spatio-temporal differential equation models, we analyse gene expression dynamics and classify stable states in a biologically meaningful way.  We exploit an approximation, based on cooperative binding of transcription factors, in which the models are piecewise smooth. At the population level, we use a naïve model of intercellular communication to explore how cells within a tumour can exhibit coordinated behaviour through travelling waves of gene expression. Additionally, we propose a method for deriving a condition that determines the final state of a population of communicating cells. This model provides a framework for better understanding some of the mechanisms driving gene expression dynamics and to inform and validate experimental hypotheses.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Effects of cellular memory and adaptation cost on the phenotypic response to changing microenvironments <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Cells inevitably encounter unpredictable changes in their microenvironment. To optimally survive, cells consequently adapt by orchestrating large alterations in their molecular states that often result in appreciable phenotypic changes. The timescale of molecular, and therefore, cellular adaptation depends on how quickly the memory of past environment encounters is lost (and therefore forgotten) by the cell (e.g. degradation rate of proteins unfavourable to the current environment). Here, we study the dynamical implications of two distinct memory mechanisms on cellular responses to changing environment. The two phenomenological models considered are – 1) Undated memory, wherein each prior environmental exposure has equal probability to dissipate in the next time step, and 2) Dated memory, wherein each experience is dated and erased according to their order of encounter. We find that the dated memory adapts faster than undated memory and confers higher growth benefit to the cell under stochastic changes or long-term abrupt shifts in the environment. Intriguingly, optimal memory for swift adaptation and higher growth benefit under periodic environment depends on the combination of cell memory size and environment period. We extend the results with these memory models to show how cost incurred during cellular adaptation (e.g. energetic cost of mRNA and protein production) improves cellular decision by delaying the phenotypic response until enough environmental change is experienced by the cell.

      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) govern processes such as cell fate, patterning, and adaptation. While multistability and oscillations are both common GRN dynamics in cell biology, they are typically studied and engineered in isolation. Here, we challenge this separation by using the AC-DC circuit, a minimal three-gene network that merges the classical toggle switch and repressilator [1,2].   Using a thermodynamic formalism, we show that even a simplified, single-inducer version of the circuit can exhibit diverse, multifunctional dynamics, including the coexistence of oscillations and multistability. To assess its synthetic viability, we use Bayesian parameter inference (ABC-SMC) to explore robustness, classify emergent behaviours, and analyse timing, excitability, and regime transitions. Remarkably, we find that the AC-DC circuit can produce hundreds of topologically distinct bifurcation diagrams, challenging the classical view that network topology rigidly constrains dynamical outcomes. This fascinating flexibility enables novel synthetic capabilities such as robust period control, coexistence of multiple oscillators, and finely tuned excitatory responses.  By revealing the hidden potential of minimal circuits and providing design principles for their implementation, this work opens new directions for cell decision and computation.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of applications, from industrial filtration and synthetic fabrics to biological cells and tissues. In bacteria, membrane channels control sensing and communication, and enable cells to filter antibiotics and resist treatment. In this talk we systematically upscale the transport across a bacterial membrane, deriving effective boundary conditions that explicitly account for the microscale channel structure, combining multiscale methodologies including asymptotic homogenisation and boundary layer theory. This allows us to treat the bacterial membrane as an effective interface, over which a significant concentration difference can be sustained. The effective conditions we derive preserve information about the microscale structure while reducing computational complexity, providing insight into how microscale properties affect membrane permeability and metabolite transport over much larger lengthscales. Incorporating these conditions into an additional population-level upscaling allows us to derive a colony-level model that explicitly and efficiently accounts for membrane channel microstructure. More broadly, because we consider a generic membrane geometry, our results hold for general (outer) problems away from the interface. Therefore, the results we derive have a wide scope of applications beyond bacterial membranes, for example, in modelling water vapour and heat loss through fabrics, as well as in industrial filtration processes.

      <div class="abstract-content">
      The Golgi has an intricate spatial structure characterized by flattened vesicular compartments, known as cisternae. These cisternae expose the contents of the Golgi to membrane-bound enzymes that catalyse glycosylation, the addition of polymeric sugars to protein cargo, which is crucial to the successful secretion of many cellular products. The unusual and specific shape of Golgi cisternae is highly conserved across eukaryotic cells, suggesting significant influence in the correct functioning of the Golgi. To explore the relationship between cisternal shape and Golgi function, we develop and analyse a mathematical model of polymerisation in a cisterna that combines chemical kinetics, spatial diffusion and adsorption and desorption between lumen and membrane. Exploiting the slender geometry, we derive a non-local non-linear advection-diffusion equation that predicts secreted cargo mass distribution as a function of cisternal shape. The model predicts a maximum cisternal thickness for which successful glycosylation is possible, demonstrates the existence of an optimal thickness for most efficient glycosylation, and suggests how kinetic and geometric factors may combine to promote or disrupt polymer production. The model is supported by experimental evidence that disruption to Golgi morphology leads to observable changes in secreted cargo mass distribution.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Inferring Environmental Stress from Yeast Transcription Factor Dynamics Using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning <br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
      Cells constantly adapt to changes in their environment, and a key part of this process involves dynamically regulating the localisation of transcription factors (TFs). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these TFs shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus in response to stress, forming complex time series that encode information about external conditions. However, these signals are noisy and often non-linear, posing challenges for conventional analytical approaches.  To better understand how yeast cells represent environmental stress, we apply deep learning techniques—specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Variational Recurrent Autoencoders (VRAEs)—to model TF nuclear localisation dynamics under osmotic, oxidative, and nutrient stress. We first train these models on synthetic time series generated via the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), capturing the stochastic nature of TF responses. We then fine-tune the models using experimental microfluidic datasets, employing transfer learning to bridge the gap between idealised and real biological systems. This strategy improves generalisability while reducing the need for large volumes of labelled experimental data.  By estimating mutual information between TF dynamics and environmental conditions, we assess how well these models capture the informational content of the cell’s response. Compared to traditional classifiers, our deep learning approach more accurately decodes environmental states and reveals meaningful latent representations that reflect the roles of generalist and specialist TFs.  Together, this work offers a robust, data-efficient framework for decoding cellular stress responses—highlighting how machine learning can uncover the hidden structure of dynamic biological systems and inform future applications in systems and synthetic biology.
