      <strong>Title:</strong> Mechanistic modelling of cluster formation in metastatic melanoma<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, yet survival rates are excellent if it is diagnosed early. However, if metastasis occurs, five-year survival rates drop significantly. During the early stages of tumour initiation, melanoma cells form clusters within the primary tumour which promote metastasis. In the absence of biological tools to visualise cluster formation at primary tumour sites, we develop mathematical models to generate mechanistic insight into their formation. For this work we utilise in vitro data for two distinct melanoma cell phenotypes, one more proliferative and the other more invasive. This data consists of experiments for each phenotype individually, resulting in homogeneous clusters, as well as mixtures of the two phenotypes, resulting in heterogeneous clusters. We develop a series of differential-equation-based models using a coagulation-fragmentation-proliferation framework to describe the growth dynamics of homogeneous clusters, incorporating different functional forms for cell proliferation and cluster splitting. We then extend these models to describe the formation of heterogeneous cell clusters by considering both cluster size and phenotypic composition. We fit the models to experimental data, using a Bayesian framework to perform parameter inference and information criteria to perform model selection. In this way, we characterise and quantify differences in the clustering behaviour of two melanoma phenotypes in homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters, particularly the cluster coagulation, proliferation, and splitting rates. We find that the coagulation rate for the invasive phenotype is much larger than that for the proliferative phenotype, and evaluate how well different modelling assumptions fit the data in order to increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving metastasis. In future work, the models will be used to inform further experiments and, in particular, to suggest and test strategies for inhibiting metastasis.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Predicting Treatment Outcomes from Adaptive Therapy - A New Mathematical Biomarker<br/>
      <span class="abstract-button" onclick="toggleAbstract(this)">Show Abstract</span>
      <div class="abstract-content">
        Adaptive therapy (AT) protocols have been introduced to combat drug-resistance in cancer, and are characterized by breaks in maximum tolerated dose treatment (the current standard of care in most clinical settings). These breaks are scheduled to maintain tolerably high levels of tumor burden, employing competitive suppression of treatment-resistant sub-populations by treatment-sensitive sub-populations. Promising clinical results in prostate cancer indicate the potential of adaptive treatment protocols, but demonstrate broad heterogeneity in patient response. This naturally leads to the question: why does this heterogeneity occur, and is a `one-size-fits-all' protocol best for patients across this spectrum of responses?  Using a Lotka-Volterra representation of drug-sensitive and -resistant tumor populations' dynamics, we obtain a predictive expression for the expected benefit from Adaptive Therapy and show that this can identify the best responders in a clinical dataset. Building on prior theoretical analyses, we obtain an analytic expression for the optimal treatment strategy, based on individual patient tumor dynamics. In contrast to prior approaches, this strategy also accounts for clinical limitations such as fixed time intervals between clinical appointments, to produce clinically realistic treatment strategies. We show that this strategy varies significantly between patients, and present a framework to generate individual treatment schedules from a patient's initial treatment data. Finally, we develop metrics (‘mathematical biomarkers’) to predict which patients have the greatest sensitivity to unplanned schedule changes, such as delayed appointments, allowing clinicians to identify high-risk patients that need to be monitored more closely and potentially more frequently. Overall, the proposed mathematical biomarkers illustrate the potential of analytic approaches to improve personalised cancer care.
